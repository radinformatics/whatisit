125	ML_PE55278	1008575	6301	CT CHEST, ABDOMEN, AND PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:  06/23/2013.-***-FINDINGS:  LINES AND TUBES:  There are overlying skin staples present overlying the right aspect of the neck.  There is a large bore ECMO cannula seen within the right internal jugular catheter with the entrance site not included in the field-of-view on the Chest CT.  The distal tip of the ECMO cannula is within the intrahepatic inferior vena cava.  There is an endotracheal tube present, which terminates above the level of the carina.  There are multiple mediastinal clips visualized.  An enteric tube is present with the tip in the region of the distal esophagus.  This tube is not within the stomach.  Multiple epicardial pacing wires appear to be present.  Additionally, there is a mediastinal drain from a right-sided approach present.  Some embolization material seen overlying the right lower lung field.  Surgical clips are seen in the region of right hilum.  There appears to be a Foley catheter balloon inflated low in the pelvis, at the level of the prosthetic urethra.  Correlate clinically to see if this is in the correct location as the balloon does not appear to be inflated within the visualized air-filled lumen of the bladder.  Pigtail chest tube seen along the inferior aspect of the left pleural space.-***-The thoracic inlet demonstrates a hyperdense focal mass seen anterior to the right common carotid and right internal jugular vein beneath the are of the skin staples, measuring approximately 5.5 cm in width x 2.5 cm in AP dimension, most suggestive of an underlying hematoma.  Portions of the vessels coursing through this hematoma appear to abrupt terminate, likely indicative of underlying tied off vessels.  No underlying gas is seen within this collection.  The internal Hounsfield units of this is 80, which may represent either blood or soft tissue.-***-Otherwise, there are nonspecific small supraclavicular lymph nodes present.  -***-There is a three vessel cervical branching pattern seen to the aorta.-***-Patient is status post unifocalization.  Both the right pulmonary artery and left pulmonary artery are patent, without focal areas of stenosis.  However, there appears to be a right upper lobe pulmonary arterial filling defects present, compatible with pulmonary emboli.  The right middle and lower lobe vessels do not enhance arising off of the main right pulmonary artery, compatible with clinical history of ligation of the right middle and right lower lobe pulmonary arteries.  The left pulmonary arteries are unrmarkable. -***-The visualized pulmonary veins are patent with two right-sided and two left-sided pulmonary veins. Note that  some pulmonary venous flow is seen in the lower right lung in spite of pulmonary arterial ligation.   There is mild narrowing of the inferior most left pulmonary vein, as it courses anterior to the aorta.  -***-The trachea is patent.  There appears to be a tracheal bronchus present, supplying the right upper lobe with a somewhat curved appearance and course.  There are air-bronchograms seen to the right upper lobe which is completely opacified.  Otherwise, the right bronchus intermedius appears to be abruptly cut off in the area of the right hilar sutures, compatible with known occlusion of the bronchus intermedius.  Otherwise, the left mainstem bronchi and subsegmental bronchi are patent.  -***-The visualized lungs demonstrate complete opacification of the right lung field, with areas of heterogeneous parenchymal enhancement present, predominantly in the posterior segment of the right upper lobe.  Additionally, there appears to be hypodensity and hypoperfusion of the right middle and lower lobe pulmonary segments.  This is likely related to the iatrogenic suturing of the right middle and lower lobe pulmonary arteries and bronchi, with superimposed infection and necrosis difficult to exclude.  There is no significant wall enhancement seen to suggest a definite pulmonary abscess.  Otherwise, there are air-bronchograms visualized within the heterogeneously perfused right upper parenchyma.  The left lung field demonstrates patchy areas of alveolar ground-glass, nonspecific; possibly related to underlying hemorrhage or infection.  No cavities are noted.  No definite areas of centrilobular nodules.  There is complete consolidation of the left lower lobe with air-bronchograms visualized, some of which likely is related to superimposed atelectasis.  The left lung field appears to be more homogeneously perfused than the right lung.  A small left subpulmonic pneumothorax remains with a pigtail chest tube catheter seen in place, at the left lung base.  There appears to be only a trace amount of bilateral pleural fluid present.  -***-Assessment for underlying adenopathy is limited due to the collapse of the right lung, and areas of nonenhancement, as well as diffuse consolidation seen involving the posterior segment of the left upper lobe as well as nearly the entire left lower lobe.  No obvious areas of cavitary lymphadenopathy or axillary adenopathy is noted.-***-The visualized abdomen demonstrates no focal discrete hepatic mass.  There is no significant nodularity seen to the hepatic capsule.  No intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation.  The gallbladder is within normal limits.-***-CLINICAL HISTORY:  Seventeen-year-old male with a history of Alagilles and tetralogy of Fallot, status post multiple unifocalizations and complete repair with conduit change on 06/05/2013, complicated by pulmonary hemorrhage.  Evaluate for underlying abscess.-***-The bilateral adrenal glands are without masses or nodularity.-***-The bilateral kidneys demonstrate some wedged areas of hypoperfusion bilaterally, particularly overlying the areas of the renal cortex of the mid and upper pole of the right kidney and some subtle areas of scattered linear to wedge-shaped hypodensities within the left kidney cortex  are noted to be present as well.   These findings may represent a sequela of previous renal infarcts or acute renal infarcts.  Underlying pyelonephritis cannot be excluded    However, there is no significant perinephric stranding or uroepithelial enhancement seen involving the renal pelvis or the ureters to suggest such.  No hydronephrosis or hydroureter.  No solid appearing renal mass lesion are present. -***-The spleen is homogeneous without focal parenchymal lesions or enlargement.-***-The pancreas is homogeneous without ductal dilatation, focal mass, or peripancreatic stranding.  -***-The visualized stomach and proximal duodenum appear to dilated with air-fluid levels present.  The duodenum appears to be decompressed as it courses posterior to the SMA.  The findings may be related to a markedly gaseous distended stomach.  Underlying SMA syndrome cannot be entirely excluded; however, evaluation for such could be clinically assessed when the patient is more stable and after the gastric decompression is performed with the nasogastric tube being placed in a position where the tip is actually within the stomach.  Otherwise, the remaining small bowel loops are decompressed without focal dilatation to suggest obstruction.  The visualized colonic bowel loops demonstrate some high density material within the ascending colon to the level of the hepatic flexure.  Otherwise, there is stool seen extending into the region of the rectal vault.-***-There is no pathologic intraabdominal adenopathy that is visualized.-***-The visualized vessels demonstrate a small caliber  abdominal aorta, which at the level of the diaphragm measures 12 mm and at the level of the celiac axis measures 9 mm and approximately 7mm below the renal arteries.  There appears to be a fairly short segment of common aortic branching to the celiac, SMA, and bilateral renal arteries which occurs high.  Additionally there appears to be high bifurcation of the iliac vessels which appear to arise around the mid polar areas of the kidneys.  The iliac themselves also appear to be patent; however, similar in size to the caliber of the lower abdominal aorta.  -***-The visualized veins demonstrate patency with a left lower extremity injection likely performed for the CT.  There does appear to be a small focus of gas within the left common iliac vein, likely from recent injection.-***-The visualized osseous structures are without evidence of acute bony fracture.  There does appear to be an elongated appearance to the vertebral bodies, suggestive of non-weight-bearing.-***-IMPRESSION:-***-COMPARISON:  None.-***-1.

The chest wall appears unremarkable.  There is a right internal jugular central venous catheter with the tip near the cavoatrial junction.   No evidence of pathologically enlarged axillary, supraclavicular, mediastinal, or hilar lymph nodes. -***-The heart appears normal in size with no pericardial effusion.  The ascending aorta appears normal in caliber, with a left-sided aortic arch and a standard 3 vessel branching anatomy.  The great vessels appear normal in caliber, as does the main pulmonary artery.  There is suggestion of several filling defects along segmental pulmonary arterial branches in the basal posterior segment of the right lower lobe, concerning for pulmonary emboli. The SVC is suboptimally visualized due to dense contrast during the injection,  the left subclavian vein is similarly densely opacified with a linear lucency at the site of the joining left IJ vein, likely due to mixing with unopacified blood at his site rather than thrombus.Other systemic veins are not filled due to the arterial phase of imaging.-***-The trachea and central bronchi are patent.  The lung parenchyma demonstrates minimal dependent atelectasis.   No pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax. -***-ABDOMEN AND PELVIS:   The liver, gallbladder, spleen, bilateral kidneys and right adrenal gland appear unremarkable.  There is a 7.2 x 7.7 x 9.9 large heterogeneously enhancing mass with internal calcification arising from the left suprarenal region with adjacent nodal spread, consistent with known diagnosis of neuroblastoma.  The mass exerts mass effect on the stomach pushing it anteriorly, pancreas pushing it anterosuperiorly.   Inferior portion of the tumor appears to cross midline with resultant mass effect on the celiac artery and superior mesenteric artery.   The celiac artery displays superiorly whereas the superior mesenteric artery is displaced to the right.  No evidence of vessel encasement of these branches.  Additionally, there appears to be a component of the mass adjacent to the left renal hilum.  Three renal arteries are noted bilaterally, with all three arteries on the left side being encased by the large mass.  The stomach, small bowel and colon appear within normal limits.   The bladder, prostate and seminal vesicles demonstrate no gross abnormalities.   The visualized aorta appears within normal limits.

There has been slight interval-***-decrease in size of a small right pleural effusion.  There has been-***-interval increase in size of a small to moderate left pleural-***-effusion.  Adjacent parenchymal atelectasis is present.-***-A rounded filling defect is present within the left lower lobe-***-pulmonary artery extending into segmental branches consistent with-***-pulmonary embolus.-***-Consolidative changes are present within the left lower lobe.-***-Ill-defined patchy areas of ground-glass opacity are present in the-***-region of the right middle lobe however, improved since the previous-***-examination.-***-IMPRESSION:-***-1.  FILLING DEFECT WITHIN THE LEFT LOWER LOBE PULMONARY ARTERY AND-***-DISTAL SEGMENTAL BRANCHES CONSISTENT WITH PULMONARY EMBOLUS.-***-2.
